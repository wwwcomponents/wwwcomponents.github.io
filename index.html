<p>Web Components are a combination of custom elements, shadow dom, templates, JavaScript imports and related <em>native</em> technology for building composable, completely independent UI elements and are <em>natively supported</em> in Chrome-current, Safari-current, Firefox 63+ and <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/?q=web%20components">in-development for Edge</a>.</p>
<p>This project exists to make using collections of Web Components as easy as possible. No build step or installation required, simply begin working with your own static files and seeing results as quickly as possible. Learn more about the basics at <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/">Google Developers</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">MDN</a>.
</p>
<p>I anticipate developing and organizing components in the coming months, in particular iterating on prior related work, especially <a href="./demo/">the demo</a>.</p>
